## Adaptive and Dynamic Nanocomposites

![Adaptive and Dynamic Nanocomposites](/assets/img/research/adaptive-nanocomposites.jpg)

We develop adaptive and dynamic nanocomposites made of polymers and nanofillers connected by reversible bonds. These materials can change shape, stiffness, or conductivity in response to heat, stress, or electric fields. They are strong, self-healing, and recyclable.

Nanofillers such as nanoparticles, nanoclays, and fibers improve mechanical and thermal strength for use in harsh conditions. The polymer matrix can include charged or functional groups to control interactions with gases, water, ions, or surfaces. For example, polyampholytes and zwitterionic polymers improve hydration resistance and ion transport for coatings and sensors, while polyionic liquids provide conductivity for flexible electronics, and high-dielectric polymers boost signal quality for antennas.

Our research focuses on designing these materials for real-world use in biomedical devices, soft robotics, energy storage, smart infrastructure, and other areas that need reliable and sustainable performance.

## Non-Equilibrium Physics

We study the non-equilibrium physics of nanocomposites with adaptive and dynamic networks to understand how microscopic structure and dynamics affect material performance. A key factor is the network topology—how nanofillers are connected, distributed, and where defects form—which influences mechanical strength, ion and charge transport, and damage recovery.

Unlike conventional materials, these systems operate far from equilibrium: bonds break and reform, particles shift, and clusters move cooperatively under mechanical or electrical stress. To capture these behaviors, we combine real-time X-ray tools such as Rheo-SAXS-XPCS and data-driven modeling. This approach allows us to track how nanostructures and particle dynamics evolve during deformation.

With the APS upgrade, we can access faster dynamics, detect weaker signals, and observe structural changes like phase transitions and network rearrangements in real time. These insights support better predictive models and enable the design of durable, responsive, and recyclable nanocomposites.

## Sustainable Biocomposites

Sustainable biocomposites for packaging use natural fibers and bio-based polymers to replace traditional plastics. Biodegradable packaging can be made by utilizing biomass waste and food leftovers, helping to save energy and cut greenhouse gas emissions.

We aim to improve polyhydroxyalkanoates and polysaccharides using a simple, solvent-free process. The goal is to create packaging films with better mechanical strength, thermal resistance, and barrier properties by adding dynamic covalent adaptable networks. These improvements can help extend food shelf life, reducing waste and emissions from food production and disposal.

This research supports a more sustainable approach by reducing plastic use, cutting food waste, and promoting a circular bioeconomy for better resource use.

## Hetero-Charged Polymers

We tackle challenges like nonspecific adsorption of biomacromolecules and microorganisms on surfaces in water treatment and marine applications. Hetero-charged polymers with cationic and anionic side groups are effective antifouling materials due to their resistance to protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and biofilm formation.

Using an *in situ* shearing X-ray system developed at the Advanced Photon Source, we investigate the structures and dynamics of end-tethered hetero-charged polymers at solid-liquid interfaces. This work provides valuable insights into the shear-induced behavior of polymer brushes in aqueous solutions and ionic liquids, advancing antifouling strategies and material design.

## Redox Gating

Redox gating is a novel method to modulate charge carrier densities exceeding 10^16 cm^-2, enabling precise control of electronic transitions in thin-film semiconductors. Unlike traditional ionic gating, it operates at sub-volt levels, reducing the risk of material damage while supporting metal-insulator transitions (MIT) in materials like WO3, VO2, and LaNiO3.

This technique offers low-power, reversible control of electronic properties without altering material structure or chemistry. With reliable performance across thousands of cycles, redox gating meets the demand for energy-efficient electronics. Ongoing research aims to refine its application for sustainable device architectures and quantum technologies.
