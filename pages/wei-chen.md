I am a chemist at Argonne National Laboratory, affiliated with the Materials Science Division and the Center for Molecular Engineering. I earned my Ph.D. in Polymer Science and Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2010 and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Argonne’s Center for Nanoscale Materials. Since 2012, I have been a research scientist in the Materials Science Division and the Institute for Molecular Engineering, and since 2016, I have held an affiliation with the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. My research centers on developing sustainable smart composites through innovative synthesis, surface functionalization, advanced processing, and state-of-the-art characterization techniques.
