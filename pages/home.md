Chen Team
Located in the Nonequilibrium Soft and Active Matter Group within the Materials Science Division (MSD) at Argonne National Laboratory, our team focuses on creating sustainable materials to address global challenges.
We use advanced synthesis methods and
in situ
X-ray characterization tools to develop materials with practical and useful properties. Our main research areas include:
Adaptive and Dynamic Nanocomposites
: We develop adaptive and dynamic nanocomposites that are strong, self-healing, and recyclable. These materials use reversible bonds and nanofiller interactions to respond to stress, heat, or electric fields. They can repair damage and adjust their structure over time, improving durability and function. Applications include biomedical devices, soft robotics, energy storage, separation membranes, smart infrastructure,
automotive, aerospace,
and more.
Non-Equilibrium Physics
:
Adaptive and dynamic nanocomposites often operate far from equilibrium, where microscopic motions and network changes affect bulk properties. Using
in situ
X-ray tools like Rheo-SAXS-XPCS, we track how nanostructures evolve and how particles move and reorganize under stress. This helps us understand and predict how materials respond to strain, damage, and external stimuli. With the Advanced Photon Source (APS) upgrade, we can now access faster dynamics, detect weaker signals, and capture nanoscale changes in real time.
Sustainable Biocomposites
: We combine natural fibers and bio-based polymers through dynamic bonding to develop alternatives to traditional plastics. These materials help reduce waste and keep food fresh longer, supporting sustainable packaging.
At the Chen Team, we are dedicated to advancing sustainable materials and developing practical solutions to promote a greener future.
